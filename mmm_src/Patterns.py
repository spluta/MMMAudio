"""
Pattern classes for generating sequences of values.

This module provides pattern classes inspired by SuperCollider's pattern system
for generating sequences, random selections, and non-repeating random selections
from lists of values.

Classes:
    Pseq: Sequential pattern that cycles through a list
    Prand: Random pattern that selects randomly from a list  
    Pxrand: Exclusive random pattern that avoids immediate repetition

class Pseq:
    """
    Sequential pattern that cycles through a list of values.
    
    Pseq generates values by iterating through a list sequentially,
    wrapping back to the beginning when it reaches the end.
    
    Attributes:
        list: The list of values to cycle through
        index: Current position in the list (starts at -1)
        
    Example:
        ```python
        pattern = Pseq([1, 2, 3])
        print(pattern.next())  # 1
        print(pattern.next())  # 2
        print(pattern.next())  # 3
        print(pattern.next())  # 1 (cycles back)
        ```

    Random pattern that selects values randomly from a list.
    
    Prand generates values by randomly selecting from a list with
    equal probability for each element. The same value can be
    selected consecutively.
    
    Attributes:
        list: The list of values to select from randomly

class Pxrand:
    """
    Exclusive random pattern that avoids immediate repetition.
    
    Pxrand generates values by randomly selecting from a list while
    ensuring that the same value is never selected twice in a row.
    This is useful for creating varied sequences without consecutive
    duplicates.
    
    Attributes:
        list: The list of values to select from
        last_index: Index of the previously selected value
        
    Note:
        This pattern requires a list with at least 2 elements to
        function properly and avoid repetition.
        
    Example:
        ```python
        pattern = Pxrand([1, 2, 3, 4])
        print(pattern.next())  # Random selection: 1, 2, 3, or 4
