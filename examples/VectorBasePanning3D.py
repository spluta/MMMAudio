"""
An example of Vector Base Amplitude Panning. Inclues a 4 channel speaker array example where speakers are placed at azimuths of -55, 55, -110, and 110 degrees. Also includes a 7-channel surround sound example.

The position of the audio source is controlled by the mouse. The corners of the screen are positioned directly on top of the speakers.
