FIX

- Mojo seems to be trying to free the numpy array inside of InterleavedBuffer without consent. I added a print statement in Grains.mojo to avoid this for now, but it's not a real fix.

Documentation

- make .md files for each of the structs in the codebase

UGens

- Shaper
- Amplitude
- Dattoro, GVerb
- Env is very inefficient right now, needs to be optimized

FFT

- we need it


Big Ones

- replace pyaudio with Mojo PortAudio bindings
