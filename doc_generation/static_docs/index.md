# MMMAudio Documentation

Welcome to the MMMAudio documentation! MMMAudio is a high-performance audio processing library that combines the ease of Python with the speed of Mojo for real-time audio applications.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Leverages Mojo's SIMD capabilities for optimal audio processing
- **Dual Language Support**: Write audio logic in Python, optimize critical paths in Mojo
- **Real-time Capable**: Designed for low-latency audio applications
- **Modular Design**: Composable DSP building blocks
- **ML Integration**: Support for neural network audio processing

## Why?

Something something about writing DSP code and higher level control code in SuperCollider, Max, & Pd, unify "language syntax" via Python and Mojo. Learnability because Python is much more widely known, so moving to Mojo enables low-level DSP thinking that is mostly abstracted away in SuperCollider, Max (except gen~), & Pd.

### Why Python?

### Why Mojo?

* Fast
* Python-like syntax
* Native SIMD access
