# MMMAudio Documentation

Welcome to the MMMAudio documentation. MMMAudio is an audio processing library that combines the ease of Python with the speed of Mojo for real-time audio applications.

On the left side of this webpage, you should see the help topics. If you don't see it, just click on the "hamburger" menu on the top left of the page to pull up the menue. 

You are in the `Overview`.

`Getting Started` outlines how to install MMMAudio and run your first examples. 

The `API Reference` outlines all of the Mojo structs and Python classes included as MMMAudio. It gives a brief description of each, and shows the available  methods available in each struct/class. 

`Contributing` outlines the guidelines to contribute to the project. This is an open source project. All the code for the project is right there in the Python/Mojo project you downloaded. We have worked so hard on this project, but I am sure we have missed something. We would love you to file bug reports and submit killer new dsp algorithms.

`Examples` is the meat of the documentation. This gives a description and shows the code for the many incredible examples found in the MMMAudio repository. Answers to most questions can be found in this code. 

However, if you do have a question, please post it on the `Discussions` section of our GitHub page. We would be glad to answer it.

## How to Use the Documentation

If you're brand new to MMMAudio, check out the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page.

The search function will be good for jumping to any specific struct or function in the API Reference you want to learn more about.
