# MMMAudio Documentation

Welcome to the MMMAudio documentation. MMMAudio is an audio processing library that combines the ease of Python with the speed of Mojo for real-time audio applications.

On the left side of this webpage, you should see the help topics. If you don't see it, just click on the "hamburger" menu on the top left of the page to pull up the menue. 

You are in the `Overview`.

`Getting Started` outlines how to install MMMAudio and run your first examples. 

The `API Reference` outlines all of the Mojo structs and Python classes included as MMMAudio. It gives a brief description of each, and shows the methods available in each struct/class. 

`Contributing` outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project. This is an open source project. All the code for the project is right there in the Python/Mojo project you downloaded. We have worked so hard on MMMAudio, but I am sure we have missed something. We would love you to file bug reports and submit killer new dsp algorithms. Expanding MMMAudio is very easy. This is by design. We want this to be a community-drive project, and we want you to contribute.

`Examples` is the meat of the documentation. This gives a description for and shows the code for the many incredible examples found in the MMMAudio repository. Answers to most questions of how MMMAudio works can be found in this code. All the examples that are documented are provided in the examples folder in your MMMAudio repository, so you can run them on your computer. There are two files per example. One .mojo file and one .py file. The .py file is used to execute the graph and communicate with the audio engine. The .mojo file outlines the audio graph used for the example.

If you are looking for something, but you don't know what, use the Search on the top right of this page!

There is a lot of information here. However, if you do have a question, please post it on the `Discussions` section of our GitHub page. We would be glad to answer it.

## How to Use the Documentation

If you're brand new to MMMAudio, check out the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page.

The search function will be good for jumping to any specific struct or function in the API Reference you want to learn more about.

Click around the left side menu or the hamburger menu to see all the topics available for exploration!
